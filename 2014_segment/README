------------------------------
Input test dataset:
test.bsq
    4-band 16-bit signed integer in "ENVI" band-sequential-interleave (BSQ) format
test.bsq.hdr
    plaintext "ENVI" header describing test.bsq binary image

------------------------------
Intermediate dataset:
test.bsq.ipw
    4-band 8-bit unsigned integer in "IPW" band-interleave-by-pixel (BIP) format suitable for "segment" program. Contains smaller header describing image attributes before image binary data

------------------------------
Output dataset:
t10-m1-n15_15_100_2500_2500/regionmap
    1-band 32-bit unsigned integer in "ENVI" format
t10-m1-n15_15_100_2500_2500/regionmap.hdr
    plaintext "ENVI" header describing regionmap binary image

------------------------------
Ancillary dataset:
param.txt
    parameter inputs for "batch_segment.sh" wrapper script

------------------------------
Script file:
batch_segment.sh

Usage:
    batch_segment.sh -i [image] -p [parameter file]

Description:
"Wraps" segment program by handling IO from ENVI format. "segment" IPW program
requires "IPW" format - this script handles the conversion to IPW format by 
rescaling the data from whatever data type to a 8-bit unsigned integer and by 
converting the image into a BIP format.

"segment" creates two log files and two output "IPW" image files. The "IPW"
image files have the names "*.rmap.##" and "*.armap.##" (# denotes the 
algorithm's loop number on output). The "armap" image is the desired output.

After running "segment" on the intermediate "test.bsq.ipw" image, the script
handles the conversion from the output "*armap" image to an image readable by
modern software. This conversion entails adding additional bits into the image 
(e.g., from 18 to 32), removing the "IPW" header, and creating an ENVI readable
header text file.

Example:
batch_segment.sh -i test.bsq -p param.txt
