** NAME
**         uread, uwrite -- byte-oriented I/O
**  
** 
** SYNOPSIS
**         int uread(fd, buf, nbytes)
**         int fd, nbytes;
**         addr_t buf;
** 
**         int uwrite(fd, buf, nbytes)
**         int fd, nbytes;
**         addr_t buf;
**  
** 
** DESCRIPTION
**         uread is a reliable interface to the UNIX read function.  It
**         reads {nbytes} bytes from file descriptor
**         {fd} into the buffer pointed to by {buf}, unless end-of-file
**         is reached, or an I/O error occurs.
** 
**         uwrite is a reliable interface to the UNIX write function.
**         It writes {nbytes} bytes from the buffer pointed to by {buf}
**         to file descriptor {fd}.  The various types of write errors
**         are detected and folded into a single error return.
** 
**         These functions provide transparent internal buffering,
**         which conceals the effects of I/O through UNIX pipes.
**  
** 
** RETURN VALUE
**         success:  number of bytes read/written
** 
**         failure:  ERROR
**  
** 
** ERRORS
**         incomplete write
** 
**                 Some number of bytes less than the number requested
**                 were written.  This is not necessarily due to a hard
**                 I/O error.
**  
** 
** GLOBALS ACCESSED
**         _uiocb[fd]      uio control block for file descriptor {fd}
**  
** 
** APPLICATION USAGE
**         uread and uwrite are intended to replace the direct use of
**         the UNIX read and write system calls in IPW application
**         code.
**  
** 
** SEE ALSO
**         IPW: uropen
** 
**         UNIX: read, write
**  
** 
** NOTES
**         The {fd} passed to uread must have originally been obtained
**         from either uropen or ustdin.
** 
**         The {fd} passed to uwrite must have originally been obtained
**         from either uwopen or ustdout.
** 
**         Calls to fpio, pixio, and uio I/O functions should not be
**         intermixed on the same file descriptor.
