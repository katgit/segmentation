/*
 *	Some comments on the semantics of the contiguity band.  At certain
 *	stages of the algorithm, we want to store information for each
 *	pixel about its 8 neighboring pixels.  8 neighbors maps very
 *	neatly onto 8 bits.  What isn't quite as neat is that we want
 *	to record different information at different points of the
 *	algorithm.  And in the general pass of the algorithm, we would
 *	really like to store more than one byte of state information.
 *	But we get by with one byte, one bit per direction, and the following
 *	changing and slightly tricky semantics for the sake of storage and
 *	speed.
 *
 *	pix_nnbr() uses the cband to indicate which neighboring pixels
 *	are at the minimum distance from the base pixel.  It is very
 *	possible that a pixel may have two or more nearest neighbors.
 *
 *	pix_merge() selects one of the nearest neighbors and guarantees
 *	that for each pixel, at most one of the cband cdir_f's will be
 *	set.  This property is important to make_region_list(), which uses
 *	the cband to determine which pixels to merge with which.
 *
 *	make_region_list() calls pix_check_bounds_and_mask() to adjust
 *	the semantics once more.  The general pass of the segmentation
 *	algorithm checks repeatedly for each pixel (1) which 8-way neighbors
 *	of the pixel belong to other regions and (2) which neighbors are out
 *	of bounds.
 *
 *	To compress this information into 1 byte, pix_check_bounds_and_mask()
 *	makes each bit of the cband byte for a pixel 1 if the neighboring
 *	pixel in that direction is out of bounds or masked out or if it
 *	belongs to a pixel of the same region.  Thus, if it is 0, the
 *	corresponding neighbor pixel is in bounds and belongs to a different
 *	region.
